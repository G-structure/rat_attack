You can also look at the docs in planner/docs/* for information on how ZED implimented their ACP client for their desktop editor, I think it would be a good idea to imitate their implimentation a bit (as long as we are still adhearing to the spec)

**IMPORTANT YOU READ ZED NOTES**

**IMPORTANT YOU MAY NEED TO REFENCE THESE CODEBASES**
I have cloned and checked out to the correct tags which match the versions we should be supporting for these following codebase.
- claude-code-acp -> "/Users/luc/projects/vibes/rat_attack/external_refrence/agent-client-protocol"
- agent-client-protocol -> "/Users/luc/projects/vibes/rat_attack/external_refrence/claude-code-acp"
