ยง TEST 2025-09-18T12:00:00Z
Added session_new method to AgentTransport trait in src/lib.rs as light test scaffolding to enable testing session/new forwarding.

ยง TEST 2025-09-18T12:05:00Z
Extended FakeAgentTransport in tests/bridge_handshake.rs to record session_new calls and return a mock SessionNewResponse.

ยง TEST 2025-09-18T12:10:00Z
Added bridge_forwards_session_new_after_initialize test that performs initialize handshake, then sends session/new, expecting the agent's response to be relayed without alteration.

Command run: cargo test --test bridge_handshake bridge_forwards_session_new_after_initialize
Failing output:
thread 'bridge_forwards_session_new_after_initialize' panicked at tests/bridge_handshake.rs:281:28:
expected result, got Object {"error": Object {"code": Number(-32601), "message": String("Method not found")}, "id": String("session-1"), "jsonrpc": String("2.0")}

This confirms the test fails as expected since session/new handling is not yet implemented in the bridge.

ยง TEST 2025-09-18T12:15:00Z
Ran full test suite to ensure no regressions.
Command: cargo test
All existing tests pass except the new one, which fails as intended.
