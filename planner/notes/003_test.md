ยง TEST 2025-09-18 15:26:46Z
- Reviewed planner/spec.md for handshake requirements (origin allow list, subprotocol enforcement, initialize meta injection).
- Read planner/human.md guidance emphasizing reuse of agent-client-protocol types.
- Noted current crate only has src/main.rs; expect to shape bridge API via tests.
ยง TEST 2025-09-18 15:31:14Z
- Added minimal src/lib.rs scaffolding exposing BridgeConfig, serve(), and AgentTransport trait (each returning NotImplemented) so integration tests can compile.
- Declared dev dependencies (tokio, async-tungstenite, futures-util, serde_json, http) for WebSocket harness support.
- Created tests/bridge_handshake.rs with FakeAgentTransport double, BridgeHarness helper, and coverage for allowed handshake, origin/subprotocol rejections, and non-initialize method rejection.
ยง TEST 2025-09-18 15:36:52Z
- Ran `cargo test`; compile currently fails with async-tungstenite/tokio link step (cc SIGSEGV) and missing bridge implementation, leaving suite red as expected.
- Relevant stderr saved in command history; see most recent `cargo test` output for failure context.
