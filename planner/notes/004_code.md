Added session/new forwarding to process_request function in src/lib.rs.
- Added case for "session/new" method that checks if initialized is true
- If not initialized, returns method_not_found error
- If initialized, parses NewSessionRequest, forwards to agent transport, relays response back
- No bridge metadata added to session/new response (unlike initialize which adds bridgeId)

Fixed test assertion in tests/bridge_handshake.rs: changed "session_id" to "sessionId" to match serde camelCase serialization.
