Added failing tests for fs/write_text_file permission policy caching:

1. `fs_write_text_file_caches_allow_always_permission`: Tests that after an `allow_always` decision, subsequent writes to the same canonical path skip permission requests but still succeed. Currently fails because the second write still contacts the agent.

2. `fs_write_text_file_caches_reject_always_permission`: Tests that after a `reject_always` decision, subsequent writes to the same path fail immediately without contacting the agent. Currently fails because the second write still contacts the agent.

Both tests use the existing `FakePermissionAgentTransport` to track permission call counts and verify caching behavior.

Command run: `cargo test`
Result: 2 tests failed as expected (permission caching not yet implemented), 21 tests passed.

Next step: Implement permission caching in the bridge to make these tests pass.

Added additional failing tests for permission caching with more explicit naming:

1. `bridge_handshake_caches_allow_always_permission_decisions`: Verifies that allow_always decisions are cached for canonical paths, skipping subsequent permission requests while allowing writes to succeed.

2. `bridge_handshake_caches_reject_always_permission_decisions`: Verifies that reject_always decisions are cached, causing subsequent writes to the same canonical path to fail immediately without contacting the agent.

3. `bridge_handshake_requests_permission_when_no_policy_exists`: Verifies that permission is requested when no cached policy entry exists for a path.

All three tests fail as expected because permission caching is not yet implemented. The failures show that permission requests are made even when they should be skipped due to caching.

Command run: `cargo test`
Result: 4 tests failed (2 existing + 2 new caching tests), 22 tests passed.

Failing test output snippets:
- bridge_handshake_caches_allow_always_permission_decisions: "assertion `left == right` failed: should not request permission for cached allow_always decision left: 1 right: 0"
- bridge_handshake_caches_reject_always_permission_decisions: "assertion `left == right` failed: should not request permission for cached reject_always decision left: 1 right: 0"

Evidence: New tests added to tests/bridge_handshake.rs, cargo test output shows expected failures.
