# Step 007 Test Implementation Notes

## § TEST [2024-09-18 09:56]

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive failing tests for fs/write_text_file with permission gating capability per RAT-LWS-REQ-041. All tests are properly failing with expected -32601 (method not found) errors since the fs/write_text_file functionality has not been implemented yet.

### Tests Created

#### Core Permission Gating Tests:
1. **fs_write_text_file_requires_permission_approval** - Tests basic permission flow: permission request → approval → write execution
2. **fs_write_text_file_rejects_on_permission_deny** - Tests reject_once permission outcome
3. **fs_write_text_file_handles_permission_cancellation** - Tests cancelled permission outcome
4. **fs_write_text_file_permission_flow_with_allow_always** - Tests allow_always permission outcome
5. **fs_write_text_file_permission_flow_with_reject_always** - Tests reject_always permission outcome

#### Security & Validation Tests:
6. **fs_write_text_file_enforces_project_root_sandbox** - Tests project root sandboxing per RAT-LWS-REQ-044
7. **fs_write_text_file_validates_permission_before_execution** - Tests that permission is requested BEFORE write execution

### Test Infrastructure Added
- **FakePermissionAgentTransport** - Custom test transport that can simulate permission responses
- Comprehensive permission outcome testing (allow_once, reject_once, allow_always, reject_always, cancelled)
- Session ID validation and tool call tracking
- Project root boundary testing

### Verification Results
```

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 7 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 14 filtered out; finished in 0.01s
```

All tests appropriately fail with -32601 (method not found) indicating fs/write_text_file is not yet implemented.

### Key Features Tested
- ✅ Permission gating flow (session/request_permission → approval → write execution)
- ✅ All permission outcomes per RAT-LWS-REQ-091 (allow_once, allow_always, reject_once, reject_always, cancelled)
- ✅ Project root sandboxing per RAT-LWS-REQ-044
- ✅ Permission request ordering (permission must be requested BEFORE execution)
- ✅ Session ID validation and transport call tracking
- ✅ Error code validation (ensuring proper error types, not just method not found)

### Files Modified
- `/Users/luc/projects/vibes/rat_attack/tests/bridge_handshake.rs` - Added 7 failing tests and FakePermissionAgentTransport infrastructure

### Exit Condition Met
✅ Repository left in state where `cargo test` fails due to new fs/write_text_file tests expecting permission gating functionality that does not yet exist.

The tests provide a comprehensive specification for the expected behavior of permission-gated file writes and will guide implementation in the next step.
