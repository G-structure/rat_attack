Observations: Added two failing tests for fs/read_text_file: one for within project root expecting file content, one for outside expecting sandbox error with structured data.

Decisions: Used timeout of 1 second to fail fast if no response. Created test file in project root for success test. Assumed project root is /Users/luc/projects/vibes/rat_attack.

Evidence: Ran cargo test --test ws_upgrade, tests failed with panic "Expected successful response within timeout" and "Expected error response within timeout".

Commands ran: cargo test --test ws_upgrade

Failing output: thread 'test_fs_read_within_project_root' panicked at 'Expected successful response within timeout'

thread 'test_fs_read_outside_project_root' panicked at 'Expected error response within timeout'
