§ CODE 2025-09-18T12:30:00Z
Implemented fs capability enforcement in handle_jsonrpc_request function.
- Added validation for capabilities.fs.readTextFile and capabilities.fs.writeTextFile both being true
- Returns JSON-RPC error -32602 when capabilities are missing or false
- Returns success response with echoed capabilities when both are true
- Refactored validation logic into has_valid_fs_capabilities helper function for clarity

§ CODE 2025-09-18T12:35:00Z
Updated test_initialize_bridge_id_response to include required fs capabilities since the test was expecting success but now requires capabilities.
