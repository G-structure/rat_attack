§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:40:43Z
- Reviewed planner/spec.md, planner/human.md, and planner/progress.md to confirm handshake requirements and step plan.
- Inspected tests/bridge_handshake.rs to extract expected behaviors (origin/subprotocol enforcement, initialize forwarding, bridgeId injection, method rejection).
- Captured current timestamp via `date` for log alignment.
§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:46:56Z
- Added runtime dependencies (tokio, tokio-tungstenite, futures-util, serde_json) to Cargo.toml for WS server implementation.
- Implemented serve() in src/lib.rs using tokio TcpListener + tokio-tungstenite handshake with origin/subprotocol validation, forwarding initialize via AgentTransport, and injecting _meta.bridgeId.
- Added JSON-RPC helpers for result/error replies leveraging agent-client-protocol error types; method_not_found returned for non-initialize calls pre-handshake.
- Wired BridgeHandle shutdown signaling through oneshot channel and join handle cleanup.
§
§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:47:46Z
- Ran `pnpm vitest --run` (ct-web); command failed because Vitest is not installed (`ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL`). No JS test coverage executed yet.
- Executed `cargo test`; compilation failed with multiple errors (private `INITIALIZE_METHOD_NAME`, missing `.await` on accept_hdr_async, unmatched `Message::Frame`, and incorrect tungstenite error constructors). Need to adjust implementation accordingly.
§
§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:49:52Z
- Addressed cargo test compilation errors: switched initialize method match to literal, awaited accept_hdr_async, handled Message::Frame, and mapped serde serialization errors through tungstenite::Error::Io.
- Reworked handshake_error helper to build http::Response<Option<String>> for proper status/body propagation.
§
§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:50:58Z
- `cargo test` continues to fail during linking with macOS seatbelt (`cc` SIGSEGV). Requires rerun with elevated permissions to let linker escape sandbox.
§
§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:52:25Z
- Re-ran `cargo test` with elevated permissions; suite now passes with 4 integration tests green. Noted lingering compiler warnings (unused ClientError payloads, unused import in src/main.rs) to address during refactor/cleanup.
§
§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:53:42Z
- Refined spawn error handling to drop handshake/websocket errors in a match arm (placeholder for future logging) to silence dead_code warnings.
- Removed unused import from src/main.rs left over from initial scaffold.
§
§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:55:25Z
- Ran `cargo clippy --fix -q --allow-dirty` with elevated perms; added clippy allow annotations for large ErrorResponse results.
- `cargo fmt` succeeded.
- `pnpm lint --fix` and `pnpm format` unavailable in ct-web (no matching scripts); recorded failure for transparency.
§
§ CODE 2025-09-18 15:55:48Z
- Final verification: `pnpm vitest --run` still unavailable (no script), `cargo test` passes all bridge handshake integration tests after formatting.
