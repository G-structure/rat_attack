In the hush of dawn, love whispers soft as dew,
A quiet promise made between two hearts anew.
It lingers in the silence of a shared glance,
A gentle dance of fate, a fleeting, tender trance.

Love is the fire that warms the coldest night,
A steady beacon, guiding souls toward the light.
It weaves through laughter, through tears that softly fall,
Binding two spirits, answering the call.

It grows like vines that climb the tallest trees,
Rooted deep, it bends but never breaks the breeze.
In every heartbeat, in every breath we take,
Love writes its story, for all the world to wake.

So let it bloom, this tender, wild, bright flame,
For love is more than words, it is the name
Of every dream that lifts us from the ground,
And in its gentle hold, true peace is found.
